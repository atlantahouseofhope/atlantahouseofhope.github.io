## Atlanta House of Hope Mission Statement

The Atlanta House of Hope, Inc., was founded by concerned community members seeking to protect children affected by immigration enforcement actions which impact their families. The immigration enforcement policies of the United States could potentially affect the living conditions for millions of immigrant families in 2025 – and many of the affected people will be children who are U.S. citizens.   The House of Hope is here to protect these children.

The objective of the Atlanta House of Hope is to provide guidance for families to obtain safe and stable living arrangements for these children – to keep them in school and protect them from the dangers inherent in living without responsible adult supervision in the wake of familial displacement.

The Atlanta House of Hope seeks to assist families, who may not have any other resources, to effectively assure safety and stability for their children.  Our hope is that the protection of a stable family environment will minimize the trauma experienced by these children and provide for better outcomes in their young lives.
