# Welcome 

{{< intro >}}
We’re a group of concerned citizens working to ensure that U.S. Citizen children do not become incarcerated, homeless, or wards of the state – in the event that their undocumented immigrant parents are arrested, detained, or deported.

With that goal in mind, we have created this website with resources, information, and the forms needed for immigrant parents to complete and have notarized. This will help ensure that their children are protected and have a safe place to stay.
